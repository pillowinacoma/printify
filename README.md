Data physicalization is a form of data abstraction that existed before writing and paper were invented. Helping humans externalize information, communicate through creation, and support cognitive thought. Nowadays it has become an emerging research area aiming to open new perspectives for data representations.
Physicalization for self-reflection purposes have been found to facilitate deeper reflection and understanding of personal data. Since our access to personnel data is increasingly rising, now is the best time to explore our own personal data.
This project aims to explore physical visualization of Spotify user specific data such as streaming history and  favorite tracks. Implemented on a published Observable notebook, everything from data curation, over to building and printing the 3D physicalizations.
